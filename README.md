# Search Engine using DFS
The **Search Engine** is a Java-based Desktop web application with basic search engine functions.
The web application has the following primary features:
  ### 1. Search:
  For a searched query, the most relevant webpages will be displayed in a ranked manner. The top 30 most relevant results will be displayed by default(The number of searches can later be changed in the code as per preferences).
  The search results would be obtained from a given SQL database to which a connection should be established first.
  The Java-based WebCrawler is used to obtain webpages from the _Worlwide Web_ using Depth Limited Search, a variation of Depth First Search (DFS). These webpages would be stored in the database and can be accessed for search queries.
  ### 2.  Search History:
  The search queries will be stored in the database and can be obtained using the **history** feature whenever required.

## Instructions to run the Project locally
### Web Scraping to your MySQL database using _WEB CRAWLER_
1. Create a MySQL database and table to store the _page title_, _page link_, and _page text_ obtained from web pages through web scraping. The SQL commands used for creating the MySQL database for this project are provided in the  file [```SQL-Commands```](https://github.com/Kashyap-Bhvajjula/Search-Engine/blob/main/SQL-Commands). Using different attributes, names etc in the database, than those in the ```SQL-Commands``` text file, would require making corresponding changes in the project code.  
2.  Open the ```Web Crawler``` project folder in any IDE or code editor such as IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code, Eclipse etc.  
3. Install the ```jsoup``` library from Maven repository in the project from the IDE.  
4. Download the ```MySQL Connector``` archive file from [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/) and extract the file. Install  the ```mysql-connector``` library as a java library in the project; select the jar file from the extracted folder as the source for the library.  
5. In the java file at ```/WebCrawler/src/main/java/org/accio/DatabaseConnection.java```, add the username and password of your MySQL database to establish a connection to the database ({} and comments have been added to where the changes have to be made).  
6. Open the java file at the location ```/WebCrawler/src/main/java/org/accio/Crawler.java```. In the main function of this java program, add the required URLs so that web data can be scraped from the respective webpages, in this manner: ```crawler.getTextsAndLinks("url", 1);``` (replace ```url``` with the desired URL). For example: ```crawler.getTextsAndLinks("https://javatpoint.com", 1);```. A deeper web scraping can be performed by increasing the ```MAX_DEPTH``` parameter in the ```Crawler.java``` program file (initially set to ```2```.). Multiple webpages can be added to the WebCrawler, I have added 2 websites in the code, and can be increased based on the preference. 
7.  Run the java file at ```/WebCrawler/src/main/java/org/accio/Crawler.java```; this java program file contains the _main_ function and therefore the project can be thus run by running the java file.  
8.  On successfully running the ```Web Crawler``` project, the required webpage data will be scraped from the given webpages and added to your MySQL database. Which will further be extracted to the webpage.

### Running the _Search Engine_ project
1. Open the ```SearchEngine``` project folder in your IDE or code editor.  
2. Install the ```Smart Tomcat``` plugin on your IDE. Then download the ```Apache Tomcat``` archive file from [here](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi) and extract it. Add a _run/debug configuration_ of ```Smart Tomcat``` type and select the extracted ```Apache Tomcat``` folder as the _Tomcat server_; choose the location ```/SearchEngine/src/main/webapp``` as _Deployment directory_; and select ```SearchEngine``` as the _classpath of module_.  
3. Install the ```javax.servlet``` library from Maven repository in your project
4. Install  the ```mysql-connector``` library as a java library in the project; select the jar file from the earlier extracted ```MySQL Connector``` folder as a source for the library.  
5. In the java file at ```/WebCrawler/src/main/java/org/accio/DatabaseConnection.java```, add the username and password of your MySQL database to establish a connection to the database (as indicated in the comments of the program).  
6. Run the _Search Engine_ project with the ```Tomcat``` configuration. A _localhost_ URL will be generated; the URL will load the _Search Engine_ web application.
